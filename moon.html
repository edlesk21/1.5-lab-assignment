      <p> When looking into the night sky, you'll be able to see the moon! The moon is a natural satillite to Earth
        as it orbits around it. While it is much smaller than the Earth, the moon plays a large role in our world today. 
        The moon procides a large gravitational pull that influences the tides in our oceans. The moon will continue to be a specticle to all on Earth until we are able to explore it more!
